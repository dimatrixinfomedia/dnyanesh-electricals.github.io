			<description><![CDATA[<p>This modern one story custom home was built on an acre lot for a young family in the heart of Gilbert. We are in love with the electrical features we added on the property and inside the home. They have the perfect backyard for playing and entertaining. There is a full size basketball court where we installed LED flood lights on top of 4 25â€™ tall poles. There are also 3 more of these light poles located throughout the yard.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This standard 2 story track home was turned into a beautiful custom home! Although nothing was changed structurally on this home the cosmetic upgrades make this look like a brand new custom residence. We provided all of the electrical upgrades on this recent Gilbert remodel and we love how it turned out.</p>
