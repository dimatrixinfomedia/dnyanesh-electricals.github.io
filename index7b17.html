We are in love with the electrical features we added on the property and inside the home. They have the perfect backyard for playing and entertaining. There is a full size basketball court where we installed LED flood lights on top of 4 25’ tall poles. There are also 3 more of these light poles located throughout the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
